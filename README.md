# Photo_Sharing_Web_Application
It is a photo sharing web application similar to Instagram where a user can upload and download the photos. The user can rate and put comments on the photos of other users as well and much more. I developed this web application using Python-Flask, AWS, MySql. Everything is running on AWS.

Below is complete problem statement:-

Cloud services are quickly replacing “web site” services, offering many more
services and options.
Your assignment is to provide a picture viewing and album creating service and UI.
All users are required to identify themselves (“login”) but not authenticate
(no passwords, etc.)
After identify themselves you will present a web page interface to allow them to
either view pictures, as well as a “title” (up to 68 characters), time and date
created (or last modified), and a “likes” score, from 0 to 5 stars, for each picture.
The web page will display (in large characters) the user’s identity welcome,
such as “Picture Viewing For Steve” followed by a series of photos, each followed
(or next to the picture) a title, created time and date, and likes score, as well
as a method for the viewer to “vote” likes for any photo (any option for voting:
box, slider, buttons, etc.)
The initial web interface will also allow a user to “create” content: upload
photos (no larger than 1 MB), and give a title for each.
The album information should be stored in a relational database (SQL), but
the individual photos may be stored in any method desired.
